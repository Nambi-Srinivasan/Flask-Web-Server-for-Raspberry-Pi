# Flask-Web-Server-for-Raspberry-Pi
I have used flask, a python web framework to run a web server in raspberry pi. My project is Smart Irrigation & Monitoring of Cash Crops using IOT.

Then Open Terminal and Change to the App Directory.

Execute the command,

**NOTE:** Ensure that there is a proper internet connection
# Closing the web server
Open Terminal and type,
**sudo shutdown now
